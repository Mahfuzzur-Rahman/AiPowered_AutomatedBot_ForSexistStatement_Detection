# Ai Powered Automated Bot for Sexist Statement Detection

Expressions that transmit, provoke, advocate, or otherwise justify sex-based hatred are referred to as sexist statements. Some groups of women are specifically targeted by sexist statements in various social platform, including discord. Detecting those sexist statements in social media is really important in modern days. Therefore, I developed a discord bot powered by AI techniques to automatically detect sexist statements. 





## Roadmap

- Collected data from kaggle 

- Preprocessed data (Remove Stopwords, Punctuation , Emoji, Numbers etc.)

- Utilized Glove for word embedding

- Bi-LSTM model has been employed

- AI powered chat moderation discord bot has been implemented which can be used to filter sexist statements







## How the Bot Works

Whenever the bot detect sexist statement it automatically provide warning react to that message. However, if the bot notices that someone has written sexist statements three times, it promptly deletes them and sends a warning message.






## Demo

Here is a demo of my discord bot :
